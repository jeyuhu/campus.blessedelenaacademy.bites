    <h2>About CampusEats</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:15px; line-height:1.6; color:#555;">
      Welcome to the CampusEats digital ordering system. Our mission is to provide students with a fast, easy, and convenient way to pre-order meals. 
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top:10px; line-height:1.6; color:#555;">
      CampusEats was created to modernize our school canteen by making food ordering more efficient and hassle-free. The platform offers a variety of affordable meals, snacks, and drinks that cater to students’ tastes and schedules. By allowing pre-orders, CampusEats helps reduce long lines, save time during breaks, and ensure that students get warm and ready meals when they need them.
